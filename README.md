# Personal-Medical-Diagnosis-System
A Machine Learning-powered personal medical diagnosis system that provides preliminary health assessments based on symptoms. It is an AI-driven healthcare application designed to assist users in identifying potential medical conditions based on their symptoms. By leveraging Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science, the system analyzes user-inputted symptoms and provides possible diagnoses, risk assessments, and recommendations for further medical consultation. 

## 📌 Features
- Predicts potential medical conditions based on user-provided symptoms.
- Uses machine learning models trained on medical datasets.
- Provides probability scores for possible diagnoses.
- User-friendly interface for entering symptoms.
- Generates recommendations for further medical consultation.
